# EV-Charging-Opt
Single electric vehicle optimized charging algorithm for integration into smart home

Coded in MATLAB and solved with convex solver CVX. This Algorithm incoporates opensource data from the Pecan Research Insitite, and CAISO energy market demand/resource allocation data to solve a quadratic objective function for day ahead EV charging

Coupled with V2G integration, this algorithm also accounts for load shed of battery and grid to achieve power balance.

In order to use, resource and demand data will also need to be downloaded and placed in same folder with script.
